# README

## What is this?

This is a basic skeleton for a React.js project

## Setup

So you want to run this locally? Alright! Here are the necessary steps you need to take to get yourself up and running:

#### 1. Pull Down Code

First things first, you need to get this code on your machine. 

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you would like for this project to live. Once you get there run

```
git clone https://github.com/CarlinCharge/react-boilerplate.git
```

#### 2. Get into the directory and install dependencies

You've got the code on your machine? Awesome! Let's get it up and running. So first things first, cd into the file directory, should look something like this:
```
cd react-boilerplate
```

Now that you're in the file directory, you need to install the required gem dependencies. Do this by running:
```
yarn
```

If you've used NPM, yarn is another package manager created by Facebook which generates lockfiles so you can avoid the "works on my machine" variety of bugs.


#### 4. Scripts

I've included some useful scripts in package.json for use with this skeleton


```
yarn start 
```
Starts the dev-server


```
yarn build 
```
Builds a production ready, optimized build into a dist directory.

You should be able to upload those directly for hosting.

 
 #### 5. Running test suite
 

```
yarn test 
```
